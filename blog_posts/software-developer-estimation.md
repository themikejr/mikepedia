## TL;DR

* Businesses need to predict when products will be available
* Humans are bad at estimating
* Looking at historical data is the best way to determine how long something will take

## The need for estimation

Generally, businesses need to deliver products to customers. The software industry is not different in this regard. Once a desired feature is described, stakeholders want to know when it will be delivered. This is where making software becomes very different compared to making sausage. Increasing throughput and through traditional methods of "scaling" (add more workers, buy better tools, etc...) have seemingly unintuitive results when it comes to software[^1]. In my opinion, the need for predictable delivery is often a harder to problem to solve than the development of a given software feature.

## Humans and Estimation

You probably don't need this to be proved to you, but humans are bad at estimation[^2]. We are bad enough at estimation that I would wager to say that if a task estimated at 4 hours actually took for hours to complete, you would be surprised.

## But, how long will it take?

(Looking back is the best way to know)

## How to Estimate

(Looking forward, you must categorize by order of magnitude)

## Pick Your Arbitrary Estimation Unit

(Just don't pick one that deceives you)
