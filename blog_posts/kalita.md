## Opinion

My favorite manual brewing device.

### Pros

* Consistency. Once you find the correct recipe, good results are easy to repeat.
* Cup Quality. Not quite as good as a V60 (when you get that once in a lifetime, perfect brew) but very clear, shows the origin well, and with decent body.

### Cons

* Takes a while to find the *perfect* recipe.
* Filters are not inexpensive.
* Filters are not available everywhere.

## Recipe

* 20.1 grams of coffee
* 280 grams of water
* 45 second pre-infusion, with approx. 15 - 19 grams of water
* 3:30 target brew time
* Precisio grinder setting: 23D

### Steps

1. Pre-wet / warm filter, brewer, and receptacle with hot water
2. Place 20.1 grams of coffee in brewer
3. Pour 15 - 19 grams of water for pre-infusion when you start a timer
4. At 0:45, begin pulse-pouring in increments of 10 - 20 grams
5. All water should have passed through the bed + filter by 3:20
6. Finish by 3:30
