Over the years, I have sought to read several authors whose work has become part of the public domain, only to find that the copies of their work that are available online are of extremely poor typographic quality. Due to this, I convert these sources to markdown whenever possible so they could be viewed using any number of markdown readers with decent typographic quality.

## Authors

### John Calvin

* [Commentary on Psalm 3](/resources/calvin-psalm-3.html)
* [Commentary on Psalm 84](/resources/calvin-psalm-84.html)
